# Moving-Average-Crossover-Strategy
The Moving Average Crossover Strategy involves using two moving averages of different lengths (short-term and long-term) to generate buy and sell signals. When the short-term moving average crosses above the long-term moving average, it generates a buy signal, and when it crosses below, it generates a sell signal.
